\begin{flushleft}\textbf{Network Fundamentals}\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain the role and function of network components
  	\item[] Routers forward packets between computer networks (LANs and WANs), and use IP addresses to determine where the packet should go.
	\item[] L2 switches forward data frames within the same network segment using MAC addresses. L3 switches can perform switching functions in addition to routing functions.
	\item[] Firewalls sit in the path that packets take through the network. They permit/deny traffic much like an ACL would do on a router. Firewalls are capable of watching application-layer flows with AVC, performing webpage verification on URIs, and retaining state. IPSs can compare packet flows to exploit signatures, log events, and can discard/redirct packets.
	\item[] An AP serves as a single point of contact for every device that wants to use a BSS. An AP uses a unique BSSID that is based on the AP's own radio MAC address. APs are often connected to a DS that uplinks to a wired network.
  \item Describe characteristics of network topology architectures
  \item Compare physical interface and cabling types
  \item Identify interface and cable issues (collisions, error, mismatch duplex, and/or speed)
  \item Compare TCP to UDP
  \item Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting
  	\item[] Router(config-if)\# ip address \textless ip\_address\textgreater\ \textless subnet\_mask\textgreater
  	\item[] Router\# show ip interface brief\\
  \item Describe private IPv4 addressing
  \item Configure and verify IPv6 address types
  	\item[] Router(config-if)\# ipv6 address \textless IPv6\_address\textgreater/\textless prefix\_length\textgreater
  	\item[] Router\# show ipv6 interface brief\\
  \item Describe IPv6 addressing and prefix
  \item Verify IP parameters for Client OS
  \item Describe wireless principles
  \item Explain virtualization fundamentals (server virtualization, containers, and VRFs)
  \item Describe switching concepts\\
\end{itemize}



\begin{flushleft}\textbf{Network Access}\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Configure and verify VLANs (normal range 0-1005) spanning multiple switches
	\item[] 
		Switch(config)\# vlan \textless vlan-id\textgreater\\
		Switch(config-if)\# switchport mode access\\
		Switch(config-if)\# switchport access vlan \textless vlan-id\textgreater
  	\item[] 
  		Switch\# show vlan\\
  	
  \item Configure and verify interswitch connectivity
  	\item[] 
  		Switch(config-if)\# switchport mode trunk\\
  		Switch(config-if)\# switchport trunk allowed vlan \textless 10,20,30\textgreater\\
  		Switch(config-if)\# switchport tunk encapsulation \textless dot1q/isl\textgreater\\
  		Switch(config-if)\# switchport trunk native vlan \textless vlan-id\textgreater
  	\item[] 
  		Switch\# show interface trunk\\
  		Switch\# show interface interface\_type interface\_number\\
  		
  \item Configure and verify L2 discovery protocols (CDP/LLDP)
  	\item[] 
  		Switch(config)\# \textless cdp/lldp\textgreater run\\
  		Switch\# show \textless cdp/lldp\textgreater neighbors\\
  		
  \item Configure and verify (L2/L3) EtherChannel (LACP)
	\item[] Manual
		Switch(config-if-range)\# channel-group 1 mode on
	\item[] Dynamic
		Switch(config-if-range)\# channel-group 1 mode \textless desirable/auto\textgreater (PAgP)\\
		Switch(config-if-range)\# channel-group 1 mode \textless active/passive\textgreater (LACP)
	\item[] you can load balance by source and/or destination MACs, IPs, or ports
		Switch(config)\# port-channel load-balance method 
	\item[] Etherchannels are dependent on many other items: speed, duplex, operational mode, VLANs, STP
		Switch\# show etherchannel summary
		Switch\# show interfaces status
	\item[] L3 Etherchannel configuration is similar to L2 configuration however:
		1. each physical port need to be a routed port (no switchport command)\\
		2. the actually channel needs to be a routed port with an IP and mask\\
  \item Interpret basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol
  \item Describe Cisco Wireless Architectures and AP modes
