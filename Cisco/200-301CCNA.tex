\begin{flushleft}\textbf{Network Fundamentals}\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain the role and function of network components
  	\item[] Routers forward packets between computer networks (LANs and WANs), and use IP addresses to determine where a packet should go. Routers remove data-link headers and trailers, analyze packet information, and then re-encapsulate the data with a new data-link frame before transmission. Routers compare destination IPs, found inside packet headers, to routes in routing tables before forwarding packets. Routing tables get their routes from static routes, dynamic routing protocols, and source headers fields found in packets recieved on local interfaces. Routers can perform many different actions: implementing QoS tools, permiting/denying packets with ACLs, performing firewall functions, advertising BSSs, and more. 
	\item[] L2 switches forward data frames within the same network segment using MAC addresses found in data-link frames. Switches learn MAC addresses from the source fields located in the frame and place this information in a table. Switches divide collision domains; unlike routers, which divide broadcast domains. L3 switches can perform both switching and routing functions.
	\item[] Firewalls sit in the path that packets take through the network. They permit/deny traffic much like an ACL would do on a router. Firewalls are capable of watching application-layer flows with AVC, performing webpage verification on URIs, and retaining state. IPSs can compare packet flows to exploit signatures, log events, and can discard/redirct packets.
	\item[] An AP serves as a single point of contact for every device that wants to use a BSS. An AP uses a unique BSSID that is based on the AP's own radio MAC address. APs are often connected to a DS that uplinks to a wired network.
