Basics
	TCP OVERVIEW:
		Server side: A server application listens for incoming TCP connection on a specific port. When a client connects to the server, the server creats a new TCP connection to handle communication with that client. The server waits for requests from the client, processes them, and sends back responses.
		Client side: A client application initiates a TCP connection to a server by specifying the server's IP address and port number. Once the connection is established, the client sends requests to the server and receives responses
		
		1. connection establishment - before data transfer, a "connection" must be established between the sender and receiver...connection begins with the "three-way handshake"
			(client) -SYN-> (server)
			(server) -SYN-ACK-> (client)
			(client) -ACK-> (server)
		2. data transfer - data is broken down into smaller segments. Each segment is assigned a sequence number for the receiver to reassemble them in the correct sequence...flow control mechanisms(sliding window) help not overwhelm the receiver
		3. acknowledgment and retransmission - after sending a segment, the sender waits for an ACK from the receiver. If the sender does not receive an ACK within a certain time frame, it assumes that the segment was lost or damaged and retransmits it.
		4. connection termination - four-way handshake
			(client) -FIN-> (server)
			(server) -ACK-> (client)
			(server) -FIN-> (client)
			(client) -ACK-> (server)
	PORTS:	
		Well-known ports: 0-1023
		Registered ports: 1024-49151
		Dynamic and/or private ports and/or ephemeral: 49152-65535

	A terminal emulator must be configured to use the PC's serial port to match the settings on the switch's console port settings...the default console port settings on a switch are (last three parameters are referred to collectively as 8N1)
		9600 bits/second
		no hardware flow control
		8-but ASCII
		No parity bits	
		1 stop bit

	THREE MAIN MODES (user, enable, global)
		>, connecting via Telnet/SSH or the console cable places the user into user EXEC mode , lets you issue nondistruptive commands
		#, next you have enable mode or privledge EXEC mode (so you have to type enable to get into this mode) superset of user mode commands .. including some commands that can be disruptive
		sw1(config)#, changes the switches configuration, you have some sub modes like interface mode, VLAN mode, Console Line Mode, and VTY Line Mode

		enable secret love - set the password to enter enable mode
		line console 0 - identifies the console
		login - tells IOS to perform simple password checking
		password faith

	CLI HELP FEATURES:
		? (provides help for all commands available in this mode)
		command ? (notice the space after the word before the "?" ... lists text to describe all the first parameter options for the command)
		com? (lists commands that start with com)
		command parm? (lists all parameters beginning with the parameter typed so far)	
		command parm<Tab> (pressing the Tab key causes IOS to spell out the rest of the word, assuming that you have typed enough of the word so there is only one option that begins with that string of characters.)
		command parm1 ? (if a space is inserted before the question mark, the CLI lists all the next parameters and gives a brief explanation of each.)

	memory in Cisco switches: 
		RAM - sometimes called DRAM, for dynamic random access memory, RAM is used by the switch just as it is used by any other computer: for working storage. The running (active) configuration file information is stored here
		Flash - either a chip inside the switch or a removable memory card, flash memory stores fully function Cisco IOS images and is the default location where the switch gets its Cisco IOS at boot time. Flash memory also can be used to store any other files including backup copies of confiuration files
		ROM - stores a bootstrap (or boothelper) program that is loaded when the switch first powers on. This bootstrap program then finds the full Cisco IOS image and manages the process of loading Cisco IOS into RAM, and which point Cisco IOS takes over operation of the switch
		NVRAM - stoes the initial or startup configuration file that is used when the switch is first powered on and when the switch is reloaded

	you can erase the startup-config file using three differend commands:
		1. (write erase)
		2. (erase startup-config)
		3. (erase nvram)
	once the startup-config file is erased, you can reload or poweroff/on the switch, and it boot with a now empty startup-config

	MAC addresses - 12 hex digits 0000.0000.0000 so 12*4 = 48 bits / 8 = 6 bytes OUI+NIC
		two types:
			Universally Administered Address(UAA) - Uniquely assigned to the device by the manufacturer
			Locally Administered Address(LAA) - on Cisco deicees using (mac-address) command on the interface...does not have to be globally unique
		
		*you can ID a UAA or LAA by the 7th but of the MAC address, called the U/L bit 0==UAA and 1==LAA	

	BASICS FOR SECURING CISCO DEVICES:
		a.) user mode and priviledged mode with simple passwords
		b.) user mode acess with local usernames
		c.) user mode access with external authenication servers (AAA)
		d.) Securing remote access with SSH

	Using default settings, a console user can move into user mode and then priviledge mode with no passwords required; however, default settings PREVENT remote users from accessing even user mode.
	Most people use a simple shared password for access to lab gear. This method uses a password only-with no username-with one password for console users and another for telnet users (vty line)...
	*so figure 6-1 you have either a console password or vty password that gets you into user mode then and enable password to enter enable mode (enable secret password-value in conf t mode)

	in either line con 0 or line vty 0 15 you can enter the following commands to apply a password respectivly
	password password-value - defines the actual password used on the console or vty
	login - tells IOS to enable the use of a simple shared password (with no username) on this line, so that the switch asks the user for a password

	
	SECURING USER MODE ACCESS WITH LOCAL USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS (decentral vs central)
		1. use the (username name secret password) global configuration command to add one or more username/password pairs on the local switch
		2. configure the console to use locally configured username/password pairs
			a. line con 0
			b. login local (enable the switch to prompt for both username and password for all inbound line con users, checked vs the list of local usernames/passwords)
			c. (optional) (no password) subcommand for best practices to remove any existing simple shared paswrods, just to keep the config file clean
		3. configure telnet (vty) to use locally configured username/pawssword pairs
			a. line vty 0 15	
			b. login local (enable the switch to prompt for both username and password for all inbound line vty users, checked vs the list of local usernames/passwords)
			c. (optional) (no password)
	
	CENTRAL AAA - you use SSH to connect to the network device and that network device uses either RADIUS or TACACS+ to communicate with the AAA server
		IOS uses the three commands to create the SSH encryption keys. The SSH server uses the fully quialified domain name (FQDN) of the switch as input to create that key. The switch creats the FQDN from the hostname and domain name of the switch. Then the third command, the (crypto key generate rsa) command, generates the SSH encryption keys
		SW1 (config) # hostname SW1
		SW1 (config) # ip domain-name example.com
		SW1 (config) # crypto key generate rsa

		to control which protocols a switch supports on its vty lines, use the (transport input {all|none|telnet|ssh}) 

	SSH
		1. configure the switch to generate a matched public and private key pair to use for encryption
			a. configure a host name
			b. use the (ip domain-name) name in global conf to configure a domain name for the switch, completing the switch's FQDN
			c. use the crypto key generate command in gloabal conf mode or (crypto key generate rsa modulus mod-value) to avoid being prompted for the key modulus (use at least a 768-bit key to support SSH version 2
		2. (optional) use the (ip ssh version 2) command in global conf mode to override the default of supporting both version 1 and 2
		3. (optional) configure the vty lines to accept the input you want
			a. transport input ssh
			b. (default) tranport input all
		4. use various commands in vty lines conf mode to conf local username login authentication
	*note cisco routers by default use transport input none
	*show command for ssh are (show ip ssh, show ssh)

	ENABLING IPv4 FOR REMOTE ACCESS - make things like ssh and snmp work the devices will need some IP 
		1. use the interface vlan 1 command in global mode to enter interface VLAN 1 conf mode
		2. use the (ip address ip-address mask) command in interface conf mode to assign an IP address and mask
		3. use the no shut command in int conf mode to enable the VLAN 1 int if it is not already enabled
		4. add the (ip default-gateway ip-address) command in global mode to configure the default gateway
		5. (optional) add the (ip name-server ip-address1 ip-address2 ...) command in global mode to configure the switch to use DNS to resolve names into their matching IP address
 
	let the switch learn its addresses dynamically assuming the network has DHCP
		step 1. enter VLAN 1 conf mode using the (interface vlan 1) global conf command, and enable the interface using no shut
		step 2. assign IP address and mask using the (ip address dhcp) interface subcommand
	
	*no ip domain-lookup - prevent the device from attempting to resolve a hostname when you just meant to type a command and mistyped
	*logging synchronous - log messages will no longer interfere when typing commands from console
	*exec-timeout minutes seconds - how long before timing out the session because user is afk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VLANs

	a LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain. (by default each interface on a router is a broadcast domain ... by default each interface on a switch is a collision domain ... by default all switch interfaces together are a broadcast domain)
	a VLAN allows you to create multiple broadcast domains on the same switch
	VLANs reduce CPU processing by devices, improve security by having different policys depending on the VLAN, reduce the workload of STP so faster convergance, VLANs make troubleshooting simpler, you can logically group people rather than having them grouped by physical location
	configuring VLANs on a single switch is simple but when you have multiple interconnect switches you need VLAN trunking between switches ... so switches will placce VLAN IDs (tags) on the frames .. you could have deticated links for each vlan but that more costly as youll need more physical connections as opposed to having only one physical cable that has the switch logically dividing the traffic

	Ethernet frame fields: preamble (7), SFD (1), dest. (6), src. (6), type (2), data+pad (46-1500), FCS (4)
	*802.1q adds this tag (4 bytes so 48 bits) in-between the src. and type fields... this tag has the following fields: type, priority, flag, vlan id

	VLAN ID (12 bits) 2^12=4096 two values are reserved (0 and 4095) so that is 4094 VLANs (Cisco switches break the range of VLAN IDs into two ranges 1-1005 normal and 1006-4094 extended range only some switches support the extended range depending on the VTP)
	*802.1q defines one special VLAN ID on each trunk as the native VLAN ... so 802.1q does not add tag to the ethernet header if the frame is meant for the native VLAN (so both switches must agree on the native VLAN) 
	*the purpose of a native VLAN is if devices do not support trunking

	CONFIG VLANS ... access ports and trunk ports
		Step 1.
			a. (vlan vlan-id) command to create and enter into vlan conf mode
			b. (optional) name name command
		Step 2.
			a. interface type number (int conf mode)
			b. switchport access vlan id-number (places the interface into that vlan)
			c. (optional) switchport mode access

	*By default each port is assigned to the default vlan which is 1 for cisco switches

	VLAN TRUNKING CONIFIG:
		In interface config mode you can use the switchport trunk enapsulation {dot1q | isl | negotiate}
		In interface config mode you can use the switchport mode {access | trunk | dynamic desirable | dynamic auto} (the dynamic auto trunking admin mode PASSIVELY waits to receive trunk negotiation messages)

		show interfaces switchport
		show interfaces trunk

		*disable trunking on ports to users and disable dtp for better security

	IP PHONES DATA/VOICE VLANS

		histroically before IP telephony, a PC could sit on the same desk as a phone...that phone would use UTP cabling, with that phone connect to some voice device(voice switch or PBX)...the pc connects to switch as normal often the phones switch would be in the same location as the pc switch
		new phones then started connecting to the IP net normally like the pc but you at first needed two different cables and the phones had legacy cables
		NOW, cisco has embedded a small three-port switch into each phone the users pc will use a patch cable to connect to the phones switch and that switch connects to a normal switch connected to the IP network
	
		*the switchport shoud be an access port for the pcs and a 'mini' trunk port for the IPphones
		Data VLAN - same idea and confi as the access VLAN on an access port but defined as the VLAN on that link for forwarding the traffic for the device connected to the phone on the desk (typically the user's PC)
		Voice VLAN - the VLAN defined on the link for forwarding the phone's traffic. Traffic in this VLAN is typically tagged with an 802.1Q header
	
	DATA AND VOICE VLAN CONFIG AND VERIFICATION
		NOTE: CDP must be enables on an interface for a voice access port to work with Cisco IP phones ... CDP is enabled by default on Cisco switches and routers
		1. vlan vlan-id
		2. conf the data VLAN like an access VLAN, as usual
			a. interface type number
			b. switchport access vlan id-number
			c. switchport mode access
		3. use the (switchport voice vlan id-number) in int config mode to set the voice VLAN ID

	troubleshooting
	*commands (show interfaces type number {switchport | trunk}) (show interfaces {switchport | trunk})
	1. confirm VLANs defined and active
	2. check allowed VLANs on both ends of the trunk
	3. check trunking on both ends config to see if one switch is acting like a trunk while the other is not
	4. make sure the native VLANs match on both ends of the trunk

	ACCESS VLANS UNDEFINED OR DISABLED (show vlan, show vlan brief)
		switches will not forward frames for VLANs that are (a)not known because the VLAN is not configured or has not been learned with VTP and (b)the VLAN is known, but ir is desabled(shut down).
		two ways to defined a vlan manually and using VTP
		Shutting down a VLAN siables the VLAN on that switch only, so the switch will not forward frames in that VLAN

	MISMATCHED TRUNKING OPERATION STATES
		two ends of the trunk should NOT be configured with switchport mode dynamic auto this command passively listens
		if one end of the link is trunking and the other is not ... the neighboring switch discards any frames it receives that have a VLAN tag in the header ... traffic in the native VLAN will actually cross the link successfully because those are untagged by design
		say you end of the link is (switchport mode trunk) ok simple enough and on that end you also (switchport nonegotiate) command ok now DTP has been disabled while on the other end of this link on the other switch you use switchport mode dynamic desirable .. well not you have a switch trunking while the other one wants to trunk however you have disabled DTP 

	SUPPORTED VLANS ON TRUNK
		switchport trunk allowed vlan command can be used to limit VLANS or add one or more

		show interfaces trunk command section outputs:
			first - VLANS allowed - VLANs 1-4094, minus those removed with (switchport trunk allowed)
			second - VLANS allowed and active - first output minues VLANs not configured manually or learned with VTP also minus VLANs shutdown
			third - VLANs in spanning tree - second output minus VLANs in STP blocking state and VLANs VTP pruned from that trunk

	NOTE: (switchport trunk native vlan vlan-id) command can be used to change the native vlan on either end of the trunk link now if they differ you can get VLAN hopping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Hop Redundancy Protocols (HSRP, VRRP, GLBP)
	1. All hosts act like they always have, with one default router setting that never has to change
	2. The default routers share a virtual IP address in the subnet, defined by the FHRP
	3. hosts use the FHRP virtual IP address as their default router address
	4. routers exchange FHRP protocol msgs so that both agree as to which router does what work at any point in time
	5. when a router fails or has some other problem, the routers use the FHRP to choose which router takes over responsibilities from the failed router

	Hot Standby Router Protocol(HSRP)
		Cisco proprietary, active/standby, 2 versions the seconds adds IPv6 support and increases the number of groups that can be configured
		multicast IPv4 addresses: v1-224.0.0.2, v2-224.0.0.102
		virtual MAC addresses: v1-0000.0c07.ac**, v2-0000.0c9f*** (** and *** = HSRP group number)
		In a situation with multiple subnets/VLANs, you can configure a different active router in each subnet/VLAN to load balance

	Virtual Router Redundancy(VRRP)
		Open standard, uses terms master and backup
		multicast IPv4: 224.0.0.18
		virtual MAC address: 0000.5e00.01** (** = VRRP group number) ex. if the group is 200 then convert to hex divide by 16 a few times until you reach 0?
		can load balance between subnets like HSRP			

	Gateway Load Balancing(GLBP)
		Cisco proprietary
		Load balances amoung multiple routers withint a single subnet
		Active Virtual Forwarders(AVF) are assigned by the AVG (the AVG itself can be an AVF, too)
		Each AVF acts as the default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnet
		multicast IPv4 address: 224.0.0.102
		Virtual MAC: 0007.b400.XXYY (XX = GLBP group number, YY = AVF number)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SNMP - application layer protocol that provides a message format for communication betwenen what are termed managers(NMS) and agents(devices)
	The SNMP agent is software running inside each device, with knowledge of all the variables on that device that describe the device's configuration
	Each agent keeps a database of variables that make up the parameters, status, and counters for the operation of the device. This database, called the MIB

	GETTERS AND SETTERS
		The NMS typically polls the SNMP agent on each device...you can even reconfigure the device through the SNMP variables in the MIB if you permit this level of control
		To be proactive, administrators can set thresholds for certain key variables, telling the NMS to send a norification when a threshold is passed
	TRAPS AND INFORMS
		SNMP agents can initiate communications to the NMS...generally called notifications
		with Traps configured, the router would send an SNMP Trap message to the NMS, with that Trap message noting .... the down state an interface for example
		SNMP Traps(SNMPv1) and Informs(SNMPv2) have the exact same purpose...Traps(less overhead on the agent) sent to the IP of the NMS use "fire and forget" UDP with no application layer error recovery...while the Informs do have this application layer recovery still using UDP ... the NMS will have to respond to the Inform with an SNMP Response message, or the SNMP agent will time out and resend the Inform
	Management Information Base(MIB) - the MIB defines each variable as an OID. On most devices, the MIB then organizes the OIDs in a tree(1.3.6.1.4.9.9.10 cisco flash group (10)) based in part on RFC, and in part with vendor propreitary variables
	*you should secure SNMP using ACLs to limit SNMP messages to those from known servers only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FTP(TCP 20 data & 21 control)/TFTP(UDP 69) - TCP/IP protocols that both use a client and server model

	(client) <-three way handshake-> (server)
	(client) <-ftp authentication-> (server)
	(client) <-ftp commands-> (server)

	Managing Cisco IOS Images - IOS exists as a file that a router will load into RAM to use as its OS...the OS oranizes the storage into a file system, which includes directories, structure, and filenames, with the associate rules
	Cisco routers typically use flash memory, with no hard disk drive. Flash memory is rewriteable, permanent storage, which is ideal for storing files that need to be retained when the device loses power...Cisco uses flash memory because it has no moving parts and remains in the device most of the time...flash can be on the motherboard or you could have removalable flash cards
	For each physical memory device, IOS creates a simple IOS file system and gives that device a name...you may have 20+ different IOS file systems in some case, but the router does not have 20 different physical storage devices...instead, IOS uses these file systems for other purposes
	UPGRADING IOS IMAGES:
		1. obtain the ios image from cisco, usually by downloading the ios image from cisco.com using http or ftp
		2. place the ios image someplace that the router can reach. locations include tftp or frp servers in the network or a usb flash drive that is then inserted into the router
		3. issue the (copy) command from the router, copying the file into the falsh memory that usually remains with the router on a permanent basis
	VERIFYING IOS CODE INTEGRITY WITH MD5
		you download the ios from cisco, copy it to your router....make sure the size in the output matches the size in the file transfer
		you can run the (verify) command against the IOS file and check to see if the hash is the same as what Cisco provides

	FTP active and passive modes:
		active mode works well with both the ftp client and server sitting inside the same enterprise network ... no firewall, no NAT between them because you may be blocking external connections
		passive mode helps by having the ftp client initiate the ftp data connection to the server. However, passive mode does not simply cause the FTP client to connect to a well-known port on the server; it requres more exchanges of port numbers to use between the server and client
		
	TFTP - lightweight, less features...uses checksum process on each file after the transfer completes
		cannot change directories, create/remove directories, or list files...but you can Get and Put files
		1. keeping all router and switch IOS images in a folder
		2. enableing a tftp server on a laptop; otherwise, the tftp server remains disabled
		3. you connect laptop to a LAN and enable the TFTP server long enough to transfer IOS images into or out of a few devices
		4. ...if you do not disable tftp not much of a threat because IOS images are available online
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4 - Explain AI (generative and predictive) and machine learning in network operations
	Generative models in network operations -
		Generative models in AI are designed to create new data that is similar to the data it was trained on. In network operations, generative models can be used for tasks like generating synthetic network traffic or creating simulated network topologies for testing purposes. 
		ex. Fenerative Adversarial Networkds (GANs) can generate realistic network traffic patterns to test the robustness of network security systesms or to simulate various network scenarios.

	Predictive models in network operations -
		Predictive models are used to forecast future events based on historical data and patters. In network operations, predictive models can be employed for tasks such as predicting network failures, anticipating traffic congestion, or forecasting bandwidth demans.
		For instance, machine learning algorithms can analyze historical network performance data to predict potential network outages or identify patterns indicative of impending failures. This allows network administrators to take proacvtive measures to prevent disruptions.

	Anomaly Detection - detect unusual paters or behaviors in network traffic that may indicate security threats or network issues
	Network Optimization - optimize network configs and resource allocation to improve performance and efficiency 
	Root Cause Analysis - analyze complex network data to identify the root causes of performance degradation or failures
	Dynamic Routing - can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and traffic patterns to optimize routing decisions
	Capacity Planning - analyze historical data to predict future capacity reqs and plan network upgrades accordingly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STP/RSTP - prevent looping for LANs with redundant links (imagine a goes to b and c but if b and c also connect now you have potential for a loop because the graph is now cyclic)
	adds a check on each interface before the switch uses it to send or receive user traffic ... check the STP/RSTP state of the port
	1. broadcast storms - the forwarding of a frame repeatedly  on the same links, consuming significant parts of the links' capacities
	2. MAC table instability - the switches' MAC address tables keep changing because frames with the same source MAC arrive on different ports
	3. multiple frame transmission - side effect of looping frames in which multiple copies of one frame are delivered to the intended host, confusing the host

	forwarding state - operations are normal
	blocking state - do not process any frames except STP/RSTP messages (and some other overhead messages)...interfaces that block do not forward user frames, do not learn MAC addresses of received frames, and do not process received user frames
	
	STP was created before LAN switches even existed, using LAN bridges to connect LANs.
	
	1. STP/RSTP elects a root switch. STP puts all working interfacers on the root switch in forwarding state
	2. Each nonroot switch considers one of its port to have the least administrative cost between itself and the root switch. The cost is called that switch's root cost. STP/RSTP places its port that is part of the least root cost path, called that switch's root port (RP) in forwarding state
	3. Many switches can attach to the same Ethernet segment, but due to the fact that links connect two devices, a link would have at most two switches. With two switches on a link, the switch with the lowest root cost, as compared with the other switches attached to the same link, is placed in forwarding state. That switch is the designated switch, and that switch's interface, attached to that segment, is call the designated port (DP)

	All the root switch's ports - forwarding - the root swtich is always the designated switch on all connected segments
	Each nonroot switch's root port - forwarding - the port through which the switch has the least cost to reach the root switch (lowest root cost)
	Each LAN's designated port - forwarding - the switch forwarding the Hello on to the segment, with the lowest root cost, is the designated switch for that segment.
	All other working ports - blocking - the port is not used for forwarding user frames, nor are any frames received on these interface considered for forwarding.


	NOTE: Failed interfaces or shutdown interfaces are placed into an STP/RSTP disabled state... STP and RSTP do differ slightly in the use of the names of some states like blocking and disabled, with RSTP using the status term discarding...

	STA beings with an election of one switch to be the root switch...STP/RSTP bridge ID is an 8-byte value unique to each switch.
	BID is composed of a 2-byte priority field and 6-bytes system ID (based on the BIA)
	STP/RSTP defines messages called bridge protocol data units (BPDU)


	NOTE: ther are mainly two types of BPDUs: configuration BPDU, and topological change notification BPDUs
	FIELDS IN THE STP HELLO BPDU
		Root bridge ID - the bridge ID of the switch the sender of this Hello currently believes to be the root switch
		Sender's bridge ID - the bridge ID of the switch sending the Hello BPDU
		Sender's root cost - the STP/RSTP cost between this switch and the current root
		Timer values on the root switch - Hello timer, MaxAge timer, forward delay timer

	1. ELECTING THE ROOT SWITCH
	ex.
		sw1 has advertised itself as root, as have sw2 and sw3. However, sw2 now believes that sw1 is a better root, so sw2 is not forwarding the Hello originating at sw1.
		So, at this point, the figure shows sw1 is saying Hello, claiming to be root; sw2 agrees and is forwarding sw1s Hello that list sw1 as root; but sw3 is still claiming to be best, sending its own Hello BPDUs, listing SW3's BID as the root.
		the BID with the lowerst priority will win if a tie then the lowest BIA will win and that Hello will be propogated
	2. CHOOSING EACH SWITCH'S ROOT PORT
		each nonroot switch chooses its one and only root port (least root cost)
		 switches will add thier local interface STP/RSTP cost to the root cost listed in each received Hello BPDU
		*switches need a tiebreacker incase the best root cost ties two or more paths: 1. neighbor BID 2. neighbor port priority 3. neighbor internal port number
	3. CHOOSING THE DESIGNATED PORT ON EACH LAN SEGMENT
		final step in STA is to choose the DP on each LAN segment so ... the switch port that advertises the lowest-cost Hello onto a LAN segment ... lower cost to reach the root, amoung all switches connected to a segment, becomes the DP on that segment ... all DPs are placed into forwarding
		NOTE: two additional tirbreakers are needed in some cases, although these would be unlikely today. A single switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain by connecting to a hub. In that case, the one switch hears its own BPDUs. So, if a switch ties with itself, two additional tirbreakers are used: the lowest interface STP/RSTP priority and, if that ties, the lowest interal interface number
		NOTE: switch ports connected to endpoint devices should become DP ... each switch will forward BPDUs to the end users on these access ports but end users do NOT normally run STP/RSTP so the switch will win and become DP on that segment
	

	INFLUENCE THE STP TOPOLOGY - BID, and root costs
		STP/RSTP works by default on Cisco switches
		default STP/RSTP costs based on the current operating speed not maximum speed
		IOS on Cisco switches has long used the default settings as defined as far back as the 1998 version IEEE 802.1D
		The latest IEEE standard to suggest RSTP default costs 2018 802.1Q, suggests values that are more useful for speeds above 10Gbps
	
	DETAILS SPECIFIC TO STP (AND NOT RSTP)
		stable: root switch sends Hello BPDU every 2 seconds by default ... each nonroot switch will change the BPDUs root cost field to their root cost and change the senders BID field then forward that out their DPs
			1. root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a root cost of 0, out all its working(forwarding state) interfaces
			2. nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports...after chaning the Hello to list their BID as the sender and changing root cost Hello is sent out DP
			3. repeat 1 & 2 until a change occurs (Hello does not arrive in time or the Hello has altered)
		
		convergance: STP convergence process requires the use of these three timers (blocking -> listening -> learning -> forwarding)
			Hello - 2 sec - time period between Hellos created by the root
			MaxAge - 10x Hello (20 sec) - how long any swtich should wait after ceasing to hear Hellos, before trying to change the STP topology
			Forward delay - 15 sec - time of the listening state and the time of the learning state that STP places a blocked port transistioning from block to forward so 30 second turn around
	
			*the switch can simply move from forward to blocking but there are TWO states before it can go from blocking to forwarding these two states (listening and learning) are important so you dont end up with looping in the mean time

			listening - like the blocking state, the interface does not forward frames. The switch removes old stale MAC table entries for which no frames are received from each MAC address during this period. These stale MAC table entries could be the cause of the temporary loops.
			learning - interfaces in this state still do not forward frames, but the switch begins to learn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface

			*so turn around time or convergence delay is 50 seconds by default in an STP network
			
	OPTIONAL STP FEATURES: EtherChannel, PortFast, BPDU Guard
		EtherChannel - prevent STP convergence from being needed when only a single port or cable failure occurs		
		EtherChannel combines multiple parallel segments of equal speed (up to eight) between the same pair of switches, bundled into an EtherChannel.
		The switches treat the link as a single link with reguard to STP (otherwise a link would be blocked) .... so both link must fail before convergence
		PortFast allows a switch to immediately transition from blocking to forwarding, bypassing listening and learning states. However, the only ports on which you can safely enable PortFast are ports on which you know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking devices(normal hosts) are connected...otherwise loops will occur


	RSTP CONCEPTS: faster convergence
		RSTP has mechanism by which a switch can replaces its root ports and or its designated ports...without any waiting to reach a forwarding state (sometimes)
		MaxAge timer is 3x Hello timer rather than 10x
		RSTP can send messages to the neighboring switch to inquire whether a problem has occurred rather than wait for timers
		Alternate port - can take over for a failed root port...to be an alternate port, both the RP and the alternate port must receive Hellos that identify the same root switch...RP goes down and is placed into discarding state and becomes a disabled port meanwhile the alt port becomes a root port and is placed into forwarding state
		Backup port(for hubs ... switch connects more than one port to a collision domain) - can take over for a failed designated port
		*each switch generates Hellos rather than just the root
		RSTP uses discarding state how STP uses disabled(shutdown command) and blocking states
		RSTP has the switches flush potentially harmful MAC entries

		"Yes, typically RSTP flushes fewer MAC addresses than STP during convergence" - ChatGPT3.5

		RSTP port types:
			point-to-point - two connect switches
			point-to-point edge(edge port) - connects to PCs/servers
			shared port - connects to a hub that connects to hosts
	
	*Cisco Catalyst switches give us three options to configure on the (spanning-tree mode) command, which tells the switch which type of STP to use

	THE BRIDGE ID AND SYSTEM ID EXTENSION: the original BID format has 2 bytes for priority and and the other 6 bytes for the MAC address ... 2 bytes 2^16=65,535
		so instead of those 16 bits (2 bytes) being the priority ... now youll have the first 4 bits be the priority (multiples of 4096) the next 12 bits will be the system ID extension (typically holds VLAN ID) ... and then the 6 byte MAC stays
		you can configure these 4 bits priority field that counts in increments of 4096 with the (spanning-tree vlan 1 priority ?) command
		to configure two switches to be the most likley to win root election you can also use (spanning-tree vlan x root {primary | secondary}) command
	
	CONFIGURING A MANUAL LAYER 2 ETHERCHANNEL(manual and dynamic protocols)
		1. add the (channel-group number mode on) command in interface configuration mode under each physical interface that should be in the channel to add it to the channel
		2. use the same number for all commands on the same switch, but the channel-group number on the neighboring switch can differ
		show commands: show etherchannel 1 sumamry ... (synonyms: etherchannel, portchannel, and channel-group)
		
		PAgP(Cisco) - 8 links used, desirable and auto keywords
			channel-group number mode {desirable | auto}
		LACP(IEEE) - 16 links for redundancy...only 8 actually used at any one time
			channel-group number mode {active | passive}

		*parameters that should match for etherchannels: speec, duplex, access/trunking, if an access port the access VLAN, if a trunk port then the allowed VLAN list, if a trunk port the native VLAN, STP interface settings

	CONFIGURING OPTIONS FOR ETHERCHANNEL LOAD DISTRIBUTION - you can balance via src., dest., or both src. and dest at layers 2 3 or 4 (the switch will look at low order bits in header fields)
		*MACs learned are associated with the etherchannel and when a forwarding the swtich uses the load distribution or balancing method
		*avoid message reordering, make use of the switch forwarding ASICs, and use all the active links (does not balance same number of bits)
		using (port-channel load-balance method) command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	BPDU Guard - disabling a port if any BPDUs are received on the port
		for ports that should be used only as an access port and will never connect to another switch
		prevent issues with PortFast ... incase someone connects a switch to these ports
		
	BPDU Filter - feature found in STP/RSTP that allows a network administrator to control the propagation of BPDUs on specific ports of a switch
		enabled ports - you can enable BPDU filtering on specific ports of a switch. When BPDU filtering is enabled on a port, the switch neither ssends nor processes BPDUs on that port
		preventing BPDU transmission - if BPDU filtering is enabled on a port, the switch does not transmit BPDUs out of that port. This prevents connected devices from receiving BPDUs and potentially participating in the spanning tree protocol
		ignoring received BPDUs - If a switch receives BPDUs on a port where BPDU filtering enabled, it ignores those BPDUs. This means it will not use the information from those BPDUs to participate in the spanning tree calculation
		impact on spanning tree - enabling BPDU filtering on a port effectively removes that port from the spanning tree calculation. The switch behaves as if the port is disconnected from the network in terms of spanning tree protocol operations.

	Root Guard - feature in spanning tree protocols that helps ensure network stability by protecting against unauthorized switches attempting to become the root bridge
		designated ports - root guard is typically applied on designated ports in the network. These are ports that are expected to receive BPDUs from the root bridge and forward them towards the rest of the network
		BPDU reception - when Root Guard is enabled on a port, the switch monitors the BPDUs received on that port. If a BPDU is received on a port with Root Guard enabled and it claims to be from the root bridge, the port transitions to a Root Guard "inconsistent state"
		port blocking - once a port becomes Root Guard-inconsistent, it is effectively blocked fro forwarding traffic. The port remains in the block state until the condition triggering Root Guard is cleared
		preventing unauthorized root bridge election - By blocking ports that receive BPDUs claiming to be from the root bridge, Root Guard prevents unauthorized switches from influencing the spanning tree topology and attempting to become the root bridge.
	
	Loop Guard - a port that should be receiving BPDUs ... stops receiving
		monitoring DP - typically enabled on designated ports in the network. These are ports that should be receiving BPDUs regularly from their designated upstream ports
		monitoring BPDU reception - loop guard monitors the reception of BPDUs on DPs. If a DP stops receiving BPDUs for a certain period (loop-inconsistent state), look guard is triggered
		transition to loop-inconsistent state - when in loop-inconsistent state the port is prevented from transitioning to forwarding state until it starts receiving BPDUs again
		avoiding loops - ensures DPs remain in a consistent state and do not inadvertently forward traffic in a way that could cause loops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP Routing in the LAN - To route IP packets in and out of VLANs, some devices need to have an IP address(and mask) in each subnet(VLAN on the trunnk) and have a connected route to each of those subnets...then the IP addresses on those devices can server as the default gateway in those subnets
	*you could have router interfaces for each VLAN/subnet though this is silly for multiple reasons...

	ROAS - uses router VLAN trunking confis to give the router a logical router interface connected to each VLAN on the trunk (routers dont negotiate trunks)
		1. (interface type nuynber.subint) in global mode to create a unique subinterface for each VLAN that needs to be routed
		2. (encapsulation dot1q vlan_id) command in the subint mode to enable 802.1q and associate one specific VLAN with the interface
		3. (ip address address mask) command in subinterface configuration mode to confiure IP settings

	SVI (switched virtual interface / VLAN interfaces) - need IP(and mask) for each SVI ... link to router should be an access link
		"When L3 switches use SVIs, the physical interfaces on the switches act like they always have: as L2 interfaces. That is, the physical interfaces receive Ethernet frames. The switch learns the src MAC address of the frame, and the switch forwards the frame based on the dest. MAC address."
		"To perform routing, any Ethernet frames destined for any of the SVI interface MAC addresses trigger the processing of the L3 routing logic, resulting in normal routing actions like stripping data-link headers, making a routing decision, and so on"
		1. enable IP routing on the switch, as needed
			a. (sdm prefer lanbase-routing) in global
			b. (reload) in enable
			c. once reloaded use the (ip routing) command in global mode
		2. configure each SVI interface, one per VLAN for which routing should be done by this L3 switch
			a. (interface vlan vlan_id) global
			b. (ip address address mask) VLAN mode
			c. (no shutdown) enabled VLAN interface

	routed interfaces - switch does not perform L2 switching logic on that frame. Instead, frames arriving in a routed port trigger the L3 routing logic (no switchport)
		1. stripping off the incoming frame's Ethernet data-link header/trailer
		2. making a L3 forwarding decision by comparing the dest. IP address to the IP routing table
		3. adding a new Ethernet data-link header/trailer to the packet
		4. forwarding the packet, encapsulated in a new frame

	ex.
		imagine you have multi-tier switch architecture....core, distribution, and access switchess...the links between the core switches should be routed interfaces while the links between the distribution and access switches should be SVIs
		it is common to use multiple links between the core switches and make those L3 etherchannels so that routing protocols work well
	
	L3 etherchannels - less checks for the channel to be operation than layer 2
		1. configure the physical interfaces as follows, in int config mode
			a. channel-group number mode on
			b. no switchport (make each physical port routed port)
		2. configure the portchannel interface
			a. interface port-channel number
			b. no switchport (yes on both the physical interfaces and the portchannel...otherwise not operational....speed and duplex must also be the same just like with L2 etherchannels)
			c. ip address address mask 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATIC ROUTES(IPv4)
	network routes: when using (ip route) command and defining an entire subnet or entire Class A, B, or C network
		ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0/0 (s0/0/0 outgoing interface)
		ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.5.3 (the neighboring router's IP address on the WAN link as the next-hop router)
	
	host routes: matches a single IP
		"An engineer might use host routes to direct packets sent to one host over one path, with all other traffic to that host's subnet over some other path"
		ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.2.2.2
		ip route 10.1.1.9 255.255.255.255 10.9.9.9 (longest prefix length)

	floating static routes: defines a route to a subnet, but the router also knows of other static or dynamically learned routes to reach that same subnet...router will look at the AD
		ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.5.3 130
	
	default routes: all destination IP addresses...if there is no route in a routing table a router will drop a packet
		ip router 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/1

	checks for static routes:
		1. is there a subnetting math error?
		2. is the next-hop IP address correct and referencing an IP address on an neighboring router?
		3. does the next-hop IP address identify the correct router?
		4. is the outgoing interface correct, and referencing an interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)

	*if the static route does not appear in the routing table ... check if the outgoing interface is up/up or the next-hop address is reachable ... if you want to get around these checks and place the route in the routing table regardless use the (permanent) keyword after entering the route
	*you could have multiple routes to the same destination due to things like manual route summaries, route autosummarization, and static routes...router will pick most specific route

IPv6 - Internet Stream Protocol used 5 in the version field of the header but this standard never came out so IPv4 -> IPv6
 
	INFORMATION FROM CHAT GPT ON IPv4 ADDRESS ALLOCATION
		CIDR - a method used to allocate IP addresses and IP routing more efficiently than with the origianl system of IP address classes. With CIDR, IP addresses are grouped together into blocks, allowing for more flexible allocation of addresses and more efficient use of the IPv4 address space. CIDR notation represents an IP address and its associated network prefix length, like "192.168.1.0/24", where "/24" indicates the subnet mask
		VLSM - a technique that allows for the creation of subnets with varying lengths of subnet masks within the same network address space. This mean that different subnets within an organization can have different subnet mask length, allowing for more efficient use of IP addresses.
		CIDR is a method for addressing and routing IP packets, while VLSM is a technique used within CIDR to create subnets with varying sizes. VLSM is often used in conjunction with CIDR to optimize IP address allocation within a network

		Before CIDR you had the following classes
			A). 0.0.0.0    - 127.255.255.255 ex. 10.0.0.0/8 (private network) 2^24 - 2 = 16,777,214
			B). 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 ex. 172.16.0.0/16 (private network) 2^16 -2 = 65,534
			C). 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 ex. 192.168.0.0/24 (private network) 2^8 -2 = 254
			D). 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 reserved for multicast addresses (streaming, online gaming)
			E). 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.254 resered for experimental use
			
			255.255.255.255 is a special address reserved for broadcast within the local network segment. It is often referred to as the "limited broadcast address" or "local broadcast address"
			
			"classful addressing was limiting the growth of the internet so CIDR allowed for more flexible allocation of IP addresses and more efficient routing"
			1. Aggregation of IP Address Blocks - with cidr multiple smaller blocks of IP addresses can be combined or aggregated into larger blocks. this reduces the number of routing entries need in the global routing tables, making routing more efficient
			2.VLSM - allos network administrators to allocate IP addresses in a more granular manner by using different subnet masks for different subnets within the same network. this enables efficient utilization of ipa ddress space by assigning smaller subnets where need and larger subnets where fewer addresss are required
			3. Classless Addressing - ip addresses are allocated without strict adherence to the traditional class boundaries. Instead, CIDR allos for the allocation of any range of IP addresses, regardless of their class, based on the specific needs of the network
			4. Hierarchical Routing - where IP addresses are grouped into hierarchical blocks. this hierarchical structure allows for more efficient routing by aggregating routes at various levels of the internet hierarchy, from global to regional to local networks
			5. Prefix Aggregation and Route Summarization - involves combining multiple contiguous ip address blocks into a single, larger block, represented by a single routing entry. this recuced routing tables and minimized routing updates
			6. Optimized Routing Tables - by aggregating ip address blocks and using route summarization, CIDR helps optimize routing tables by reducing their size and complexity. this leads to faster routing lookups and more efficient use of router resources
			7. Address Space Conservation -  more efficent allocation of ip addresses, reducing the wastage of address space. by allocating addresses based on actual need rather than predefined class boundaries, CIDR helps conserve IPv4 address space, which was becoming increasingly scarce
			8. Enhanced Scalability - allowing for more flexible allocation of IP addresses and more efficient routing. this enables the internet to accommodate a larger number of devices and networks without the need for excessive routing table growth
			9. Reduced Routing Table Growth - aggregation and summarization techniques minimize the number of routing entries required to represent the entire internet, resulting in slower growth of routing tables
			10. Support for Variable-Length Prefixes - allowing for the allocation of IP address blocks of varying sizes. This flexibility enables network to be allocated only the number of addresses they actually need, leading to more efficient address space utilization


	IPv4 addresses have 32 bits that is 4 octets so 2^32=4,294,967,296 so that about 4 trillion then you have things like CIDR,VLSM, NAT, PAT to extend that number a bit further
	IPv6 has 8 quartets of hex digits, EACH HEX DIGIT IS 4 BINARY DIGITS, so thats 8 sets of 16 bits 8*16=128...2^128
	340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 roughly three-hundred fourty undeciallion addresses
	IPv6 uses /prefix only so no dotted decimal
	
	ABBREVIATING IPv6 ADDRESS (2000:ab78:0020:01bf:ed89:0000:0000:0001 -------> 2000:ab78:20:1bf:ed89::1) (fe80::2:0:0:fbe8 -------> fe80:0000:0000:0000:0002:0000:0000:fbe8)
		*remove leading zeros in quartets
		*if a quartet is all zeros :0000: -> :0:
		*(just an example hex is 0-F)if you have consectutive zeros 0000:0000:0000:abcd:efgh:ijkl:mnop:qrst then this could be shortented -> ::abdc:efgh:ijkl:mnop:qrst you can only do this once for the first set of zeros because if done twice the address is ambigious
	
	
	typically, an enterprise requesting IPv6 addresses from their ISP will receive a /48 block
	typically, IPv6 subnets use a /64 prefix length so you will have 16 bits to subnet with and the remaining 64 bits can be used for hosts
	if you do not have a prefix length that is a multiple of four like a /93:
		2001:0db8:8b00:0001:fb89:017b:0020:0011 /93 so every hex digit is 4 bits so every quartet is 16 bits so 16 32 48 64 80 | 96
		2001 : 0db8 : 8b00 : 0001 : fb89 : 017b : 0020 : 0011/93
		16      32       48      64      80      96      112     128
				              : 017b :
					we only need the first bit of the b | b -> 0d11 -> 0b1011 so just the 1 -> ob1000 -> 8 so the network  prefix is
		2001 : db8 : 8b00 : 1 : fb89 : 0178 ::/93 this is the prefix or network address

	GLOBAL ROUTING PREFIX(the prefix length of the global routing prefix is often between /32 and /48, or possibly as long as /56): a set of addresses that only one company can use
		"The term actually refers to the idea that Internet routers can have one route that refers to all the addresses inside the address block, without a need to have routes for smaller parts of that block."
	PREFIX ID(subnet ID) - globaly routing prefix bits and subnet bits
	INTERFACE ID - host portion

	(ipv6 unicast-routing) - enables ipv6 routing, which is NOT enabled by default

	GLOBAL UNICAST ADDRESS(2000::/3): globally unique(more than likely) addresss used for hosts...works like IPv4 originally intended
		*Originally, IANA reserved all IPv6 addresses that begin with hex 2 or 3 as global unicast addresses (2000::/3) ... 0010 to 0011:FFFF.. but now these addresses include any address not allocated for other purposes
		
	UNIQUE LOCAL ADDRESS() : act as private IPv6 addresses
		(IANA actually reserves prefic FC00::/7...RFC 4193 requiures the eighth bit of these addresses is set to 1)...
		Use FD as the first two hex digits...append 40-bits to create 48-bit prefix that you will use for all addresses...use next 16-bits for subnets..
		you do NOT need to register to use them
		do NOT need to be globally unique...but you should attempt to make them so
		private address that cannot be used over the internet
		*the global ID should be unique so that addresses do NOT overlap when companies merge (random number generator logic RFC 4193)
	
	LINK LOCAL ADDRESS(prefix FE80::/10): a packet sent to any link local address will not be forwarded by any router to another subnet
		Unicast (not multicast): represent a single host, will only be processed by only that one IPv6 host
		Forwarding scope is the local link only: do not leave local data link because routers do not forward packets with link-local destination addresses
		Automatically generated: every host interface can create its own link-local address automatically, solving some initialization problems for hosts before they learn a dynamically leanred global unicast address
		Common uses: overhead protocols that stay local to one subnet and as the next-hop address for IPv6 routes

		after the prefix FE80::/10 should be all zeros for the first 64 bits of the address and for the second half there are few options...EUI-64, random genereation, manually configured(ipv6 address address link-local)
		IOS creates a link-local address for any interface that has configured at least one other unicast address using the (ipv6 address) command
		WAN links do not needa  global unicast address the (ipv6 enable) interface subcommand enables IPv6 processing and adds a link-local address, but adds no other unicast IPv6 addresses

	MULTICAST(FF30::/12): like IPv4, IPv6 includes a range of multicast addresses that can be used by multicast applications, with many of the same fundamental concepts as IPv4 multicasts.
		IPv6 RFC reserver multicast address for specific purposes too for OSPFv3 for example: FF02::5 (all routers) and FF02::6 (all DR routers)
		FF02::1 - all-nodes (all interfaces that use IPv6 that are on the link)
		FF02::2 - all-routers (all ipv6 router interfaces on the link)
		FF02::5 - all ospf routers
		FF02::6 - all ospf designated routers
		FF02::9 - all RIPng routers
		FF02::A - all routers using EIGRP for IPv6
		FF02::1:2 - all routers acting as a DHCPv6 relay agent

		IPv6 Multicast Scope Terms: (Scope name, First Quartet, Scope Defined by, Meaning)
			interface local - FF01 - derived by device - packets to services running on the same host
			link local - FF02 - derived by device - routers that receive these do not forward
			site local - FF05 - configuration on routers -inbetween link local and organization
			organization local - FF08 - broader than site local
			global - FF0E - no boundaries

	Dynamic Unicast Address Configuration: Stateful DHCP, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration(SLAAC)
	EUI-64: when configuring the ip with the (ipv6 address address/prefix-length [eui-64]) input the prefix...though IOS should allow you to input the entire address aswell
		Ethernet interfaces have a universal MAC address to create their EUI-64 interface IDs ... you can also configure the MAC address with the (mac-address) command
		1. split 6-byte  (12-hex-digits) MAC address in two halves
		2. insert FFFE in between in the wtwo, makeing the interface ID now have a total of 16 hex digits (64 bits)
		3. invert the seventh bit of the interface ID

	Solicited-Node Multicast Addresses(FF02::1:FF_ _ : _ _ _ _): NDP replaces IPv4 ARP and it improves MAC-discovery process by using these Solicited-Node Multicasts because the hosts on the subnet to whom the packet is not meant for does less overhead processing to discard these
		NOTE: routers calulate a matching solicited node multicast address for every unicast address on an interface (both link local and global unicast addresses will get one)
		FF02::1:FF and the last six hex digits are taken from the unicast address
	
	Misc. addresses: :: (unkown), and ::1 (loopback IPv6 address)

	IMPLEMENTING IPv6 ROUTING
		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security
	do NOT store passwords in IOS devices, instead use AAA
	The older (password) command stores clear text in the config file without any hashing
	if you use both the (password) command and the (secret) command the secret command has priority over the password command
	if using the (password) command conjoin this with the use of the (service password-encryption) command to make security slightly better for those commands that include "password" keyword?
	The (service password-encryption) uses encoding type 7
	after entering enable mode you can delete the enable pass with the (no enable secret) command without providing any information at that point...you can also overwrite the old password
	NOTE: some IOS features require that the router knows a clear-text password via the username command (for instance, when performing some common authentication methods for serial links called PAP and CHAP)
	(algorithm-type {type}) keyword allows you to pick encoding scheme for the broader command	

	ENCODING TYPES:
		0 - plaintext, DO NOT USE
		4 - Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2(PBKDF2), single iteration of SHA-256, not salt, DO NOT USE
		5 - Message-Digest(MD5), 100 iterations, 32-bit salt, NOT NIST APPROVED
		6 - AES, reversible 128-bit AES algo, USE ONLY WHEN REVERSIBLE ENCRYPTION IS NEED OR WHEN TYPE 8 IS NOT AVAILABLE
		7 - alphabetical subsitution Vigenere cipher with a hardcoded public known key, DO NOT USE
		8 - PBKDF2, SHA-256, 80-bit salt, 20,000 iterations, less resource intensive that type 9, RECOMMENDED
		9 - Scrypt hasing algo, 80-bit salt, 16384 iterations, NOT NIST APPROVED

	TRADITIONAL FIREWALLS - sits in forwarding path, permit/deny packets through, basic firewalls do what routers do with ACLs + more packet-filtering options and other security tasks
		standard acl functions (src. and dest. IP)
		extended acl functions (well-known TCP/UDP port)
		watch application-layer flows to know what additional TCP and UDP ports are used by a particular "flow"
		match the text in the URI of an HTTP request (web page identification)
		retains state information about each packet, and makes decisions about filtering future packets based on the history (stateful inspection)
			ex. a server will experice traffic with some sort of consistency... the firewall could recognize traffic outside the norm
		firewalls use the concept of security zones which define whcih hosts can initiate new connections from one "zone" to another
		companies typically have an inside zone, an outside zone, and a DMZ

	Intrusion Prevention Systems(IPS) - like a firewall these sit in the path packets take through the network, these filter packers, but these use different logic
		IPSs download exploit signatures into a database ... these signatures define different header field values found in sequences of packets used in known exploits
		if the packet examined matches one of these signatures the IPS can log the event, discard packets, or even redirect the packets to another security application for further examination
		*from the time a zero-day is found by some researcher to the time that exploit it being propagated/reported there wont be a signature in theses databases

	NGFW/NGIPS - Cisco acquires Sourcefire 2013 2.1B (proliferation of mobile devices is a hot topic)
		*consider the following:
		1. Each IP-based application should use a well-known port
		2. It is known that firewalls will filter most well-known ports from sessions initiated from the outside zone to the inside zone
		3. port scanning is used to find any port that a companies firewall will allow through right now
		4. attacker want to use a protocol of their choosing on a nonstandard port they find that is open as a way to connect to hosts inside the enterprise

		NGFWs will look at application later data to ID the application instead of relying solely on the TCP and USP port numbers used.
		Ciscos preforms deep packet inspection with their Application Visibility and Control(AVC) feature using applicatino layer headers + application layer data structures
			
		features of NGFW
			statefull firewall filtering, NAT/PAT, and VPN termination
			AVC ... identify the application from the data rather than the port number to defend against the use of random port numbers
			malware protection - a network-based antimalware function can be run on the firewall itself, blocking file transfers that would install malware, and saving copies of files for later analysis
			URL filtering - Cisco talos group monitors and creates reputation scores for each domain known in the Internet, with those scores used to decided to categorize, filter, or rate limit
			NGIPS along with firewall

		features of NGIPS
			consider the following: IPS compares the signature database to all messages, lots of events genreated more than is human readable(needle in a haystack)		
			NGIPS can collect a bunch of data about the hosts and the users of those hosts...OS, software revision lvls, running apps, open ports, transport protocols, port numbers in use...etc...
			NGIPS can de-emphasize checks for explois that do not apply to those endpoints
			
			compare packet flows to exploit signatures, log events, discard/redirct packets
			AVC - look into application layer data to ID the application
			Contestual awareness - gather data from hosts ... reducing logged events
			Reputation- Filtering - cisco talos 
			Event Impact Level - the degree to which an event logged may impact the oprtation of the network

	PORT SECURITY - if the network engineer knows what device should be cabled and connected to particular interfaces on a switch, the engineer can use port security to restrict that interface so that only the expected devces can use it
		some show commands (show interfaces, show interfaces status, show port-security, show port-security interfaces)
		if inappropriate devices attempt to send frames to that switch interface, the switch can take different actions...ranging from informational messages to shutting down that interface
		IDs devices based on src. MAC addresses in frames
		port sec. is enabled per port and can have different parameters per port
		each port has a max number of addresses permitted...you can specifically allow certain MACs or have MACs learned dynamically
		*works on both access and trunk ports but you have to manually configure the access/trunks you cannot have that done dynamically
		*for voice ports make sure to allow at least two MACs(one for the PC and one for the phone)
		*when applying to etherchannels make sure to place this on the port-channel interface, rather than each individual physical interface in that channel
		*once a port has switchport sec enables MACs learned dynamically will not appear with the (show mac address-table dynamic) command they will be displayed with either (show mac address-table secure) or (show mac address-table static)
			
		configurations and commands: 
				1. (swtichport mode {access | trunk}) 
				2. (switchport port-security)  enable port security
				3. (switchport port-security maximum number) override the default max number of allowed MACs associated with the interface (1)
				4. optional (switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict}) override the default action to take upon a security violation (shutdown)
				5. optional (switchport port-security mac-address mac-address) predefine any allowed src MACs
				6. optional (switchport port-security mac-address sticky) "sticky learn" dynamically learned MACs

		three violation modes (switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown})	all of which discards offending traffic
		shutdown (default):
			interface state - err-disabled state (to take it out of this state you have to shut it down and turn it back on manually) or use (errdiable recovery cause psecure-violation) to automatically recover... (errdisable recovery interval sec) to add delay
			port security state - secure-shutdown
			*the switch stops sending and receiving frames on the interface
		protect: discard the frame...does not generate log...does not increment violation counter...interface remains up/up
		restrict: provides a comprmise between the other two modes ... remains secure-up state...accurate incrementing of violation counter and produces syslog messages
		
	DHCP - on of the most common services in a TCP/IP network, for a host with no IPv4 address, no mask, no default gateway...allows you, as the host, to temp. lease or potentially permanent assignment
		Discover(client), Offer(server), Request(client), Achknowledgment(server)
		Release(client), Decline(client)
		0.0.0.0 - used as a src. IP for hosts without one
		255.255.255.255 - local broadcast IP address. Packets sent to this dest. address are broadcast on the local data link, but routers do not forward them(by default)

		(ip helper-address server-ip) tells the router to do the following for the messages coming in an interface, from a DHCP client:
			1. watch for incoming DHCP messages, with dest. IP address 255.255.255.255
			2. change that packet's src. IP address to the router's incoming interface IP address
			3. change that pacvket's dest. IP address to the address of the DHCP server (as configured with the command)
			4. route the packet to the DHCP server
			*router uses a similar process for the return DHCP messages from the server, First, for the return packet from the DHCP server, the server simply reverses the src. and dest. IP address of the packet received from the router (relay agent)
			*When a router receives a DHCP message, addressed to one of the router's own IP addresses, the router realized the packet might be part of the DHCP relay feature. The router need to change the destination IP address, so that the real DHCP client, which does not have an IP address yet, can receive and process the packet...the router changes the dest. address to 255.255.255.255

		types of settings (typically organized by subnet) the DHCP server needs to support DHCP clients:
			Subnet ID and mask
			Reserved (excluded) addresses
			Default router(s)
			DNS IP address(es)

		DHCP uses three allocation methods:
			Dynamic - from a pool
			Automatic - similar to dynamic because there is a pool...same IP address assigned to a device every time it connects...server keeps track of MAC addresses
			Static - specific IP address to a device based on their MAC address...commonly used for device that require a fixed IP address for services like servers, printers, or network devices
			
		(ip address dhcp) command can be used on switches and routers

		*Host settings for IPv4: DNS server IP address, default gateway IP, IP and mask of it's own
	
	DHCP SNOOPING and DYNAMIC ARP INSPECTION - used to mitigate attacks on the most common IPv4 protocol
		snooping acts like a firewall/ACL in many ways...it analyzes incoming messages on the specified subset of ports in a VLAN
		while DHCP is L3 ... snooping is commonly used on L2 LAN switches and enabled on L2 ports
		rules:
			received on an untrusted port...sent by server...discarded
			received on an untrusted port...sent by client...possibly filtered
			received on a trusted port...forward

			1. examine all incoming DHCP messages
			2. if normally sent by servers, discard the message
			3. if normally sent by clients filter:
				a.) for DISCOVER and REQUEST messages, check for MAC address consistency between the Ethernet frame and the DHCP message
				b.) for RELEASE OR DECLINE messages, check the incoming interface plus IP address versus the DHCP Snooping binding table
			4. For mesages not filtered that result in a DHCP lease, build a new entry to the DHCP Snooping binding table
			
		*The Spurious DHCP server: attacker listend on local subnet for DHCPDISCOVERS and replies before an other server and proceeds to MITM by become the default gateway
		*NOTE: DHCP messages define the chaddr(client hardware address) field to identify the client

		CONFIGURING DHCP SNOOPING (show ip dhcp snooping)
			1. configuring these are both required
				a.) (ip dhcp snooping)
				b.) (ip dhcp snooping clan 11)
			2. (OPTIONAL) (no ip dhcp snooping information option) global command on L2 switches to disable the insertion of DHCP Option 82 data into DHCP messages, specifically on switches that do not act as a DHCP relay agent
			3. (ip dhcp snooping trust) interface subcommand to override the default setting of not trusted
			4. (OPTIONAL) configure DHCP Snooping rate limits and err-disaled recovery:
				a.) (OPTIONAL) (ip dhcp snooping limit rate number) interface subcommand to set a limit of DHCP messages per second
				b.) (OPTIONAL) (no ip dhcp snooping limit rate number) interface subcommand to remove an existing limit and reset the interface to use the default of no rate limit
				c.) (OPTIONAL) (errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit) global command to enable the feature of automatic recovery from err-disabled mode, assuming the switch placed the port in err-disabled state because of exceeding DHCP Snooping rate limits 
				d.) (OPTIONAL) (errdisable recovery interval seconds) global commands to set the time to wait before recovering from an interface err-disabled state (reguardless of the cause of the err-disabled state)
				
		Dynamic Arp Inspection(DAI): confirms an ARP's correctness based on DHCP Snooping's data about the earlier DHCP messages...DAI can optionally perform other checks as well...for example the Ethernet header that encapsulates the ARP should have addresses taht match the ARP origin and target MAC address
			NOTE: although DAI can use the DHCP Snooping table, it can also use similar statically configured data that lists correct pairs of IP and MAC addresses via a tool called ARP ACLs....this is useful for ports connected to devices that use static IP addresses rather than DHCP...DDAI looks for both the DHCP Snooping binding data and ARP ACLs
			* messages with an Ethernet header source MAC address that is not equal to the ARP origin hardware (MAC) address
			* ARP reply messages with an Ethernet header destination MAC address that is not equal to the ARP target hardware (MAC) address
			* messages with unexpected IP addresses in the two ARP IP address fields

		ARP CONFIGURATION: (show ip arp inspection interfaces)
			1. (ip arp inspection vlan vlan-list) global command to enable DAI on the switch for the specified VLANs
			2. separate from the DAI configuration, also configure DHCP Snooping and/or ARP ACLs for use by DAI
			3. (ip arp inspection trust) interface subcommand to override the defaul setting of not trusted
			4. (OPTIONAL) configure DAI rate limits and err-disabled recovery
				a.) (ip arp inspection limit rate number [burst interval seconds]) interface subcommand to set a limit of ARP messages per second, or ARP messages for each configured interval
				b.) (ip arp inspection limit rate none) interface subcommand to disable rate limits
				c.) (errdisable recovery cause arp-inspection) global command to enable the feature of automatic recovery from err-disabled mode, assuming the switch placed the port in err-disabled state because of exceeding DAI rate limits
				d.) (errdisable recovery interval seconds) global commands to set the time to wait before recovering from an interface err-disabled state (reguardless of the cause of the err-disabled state)
			5. (OPTIONAL) (ip arp inspection validate {[dst-mac] [src-mac] [ip]}) global command to add DAI validation steps


	ACCESS CONTROL LISTS(ACL)
		
	Human Security Vulns:
		Social engineering - an attack that exploits human trust and social behavior
		Phishing - malicious invitation disguised as something legit
		Spear Phishing - targets one or more specific individuals for a phishing attack
		Whaling - is an attack that targets a high-profile individual, such as a CEO or CIO of a company
		Vishing - voice
		Smishing - SMS
		Pharming - uses legitmate services to send users to a compromised site
		Watering hole - IDs users and then attracts them to a compromised site

Domain Name System(DNS) - translates human-readable domain names into IP address
	1. User Requests a Domain: (www.example.com into firefox)
	2. Local DNS Resolver: Your computer will first checks its local DNS resolver cache. This cache stores recently accessed domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. If the IP address for www.example.com is found in the cache, the process ends here, and the browser connects to the website
	3. Recursive DNS Servers: If the IP address is not in the local cache, your computer contacts a recursive DNS server (ISP or configured by you). The recursive DNS server is like an internet directory assistance server. It either provices the IP address if it already knows it or starts a search to find it.
	4. Root: If the recursive server does not have the IP address, it starts by asking one of the 13 root name servers. These servers know the IP addresses of the authoritativve name servers for each top-level domain, like .com, .org, .net, etc.
	5. TLD: The root server directs the recursive server to the appropriate TLD name server for the requested domain (e.g., .com). The TLD name server stores information about domain names within its top-level domain. For exmaple, the .com name server knows the IP address of the authoritative name server for example.com
	6. Authoritative Name Servers: the recursive server now queries the authoricative name server for the specific domain (e.g., example.com). This server holds the most up-to-date information about the domain, including the IP address associated with www.example.com
	7. Response: The authoritative name server responds to the recursive server with the IP address for www.example.com
	8. Caching: The recursive server caches the IP address for future reference and sens it back to your computer
	9. Now armed with the IP address, your computer connects to the web server hosting www.example.com, and you can access the website.

Device Mangement Protocols - CDP/LLDP, NTP, syslog
	CDP/LLDP(802.1AB) - L2 discovery protocols share information with and discover information about neighboring (connected) devices
		*because they share infomation about the devices in the network, they can be considered a security risk and are often not used
		*device identifier, address list, port identifier, capabilities list, platform
		*provides information to the devices to support some function...and to provide information to engineers...ex Cisco IP Phones use CDP to learn the data and voice VLAN IDs configured on an access switch
		*CDP defines encapsulation that uses the data-link header, but no IP header

		CDP (show cdp, cdp interface, show cdp traffic, show cdp neighbors [detail], show cdp entry {name})
			routers, switches, firewalls, IP phones, etc ... have cdp enabled by default
			periodically sent to multicast MAC address 0100.0ccc.cccc
			when a device receives a cdp messages, it processes and discards the messages. It does NOT forward it to other devices
			by default messages are sent every 60 seconds and there is a holdtime of 180 seconds if a messages does not arrive in the hold time the device is dropped from the CDP neighbor table
			CONFIGS
			*([no] cdp run) globally and ([no] cdp enable) on interfaces
			*(cdp timer seconds) *(cdp holdtime seconds) 

		LLDP (show lldp traffic, show lldp interface, show lldp, show lldp neighbors [detail], show lldp entry {name}) - usually disabled on cisco devices by default and disabled on all interfaces... can run with CDP at the same time
			LLDP messages are peridodically sent to multicast MAC address 0180.c200.000e
			just like CDP does not forward these messages once received
			by default messages are sent every 30 seconds and the hold timer is 120 seconds
			*LLDP has an additional timer called the 'reinitialization delay'...if LLDP is enabled, this timer will delay the actual initialization of LLDP 2 seconds by default to prevent 'flapping' where the protocol is being enabled and disabled rapidly
			CONFIGS
			([no lldp run]) to enable/disable globally
			to enable LLDP on specific interfaces (lldp transmit)
			to enable LLDP on a specific interface (lldp receive)
			(lldp timer seconds) and (lldp holdtime seconds) and (lldp reinit seconds)

		*LLDP uses B aso the capability code for switching
		*LLDP does NOT identify IDMP as a capability, while CDP does (I) (Internet GRoup Management Protocol...It is a communications protocol used by IP hosts and adjacent multicast routers to establish multicast group memeberships. In simpler terms, it is a protocol used to manage multicast group memberships in a network...when a host wants to receive multicast traffic for a specific group, it uses IGMP to inform the local multicast router that it wants to join that group. The router then knows to forward mulicast traffic for that group to the requesting host..IGMP operates at the network later and is integral for IP multicast...comonly used for IPTV, online gaming, etc)
		*CDP list the neighbor's platform, a code that defines the device type, while LLDP does not
		*LLDP lists capabilities with different conventions
		*CDP lists all the capabilities of the neighbor in show cdp neighbors command while LLDP would list configured capabilities (can also show system capabilities with other commands)
		
	Syslog - protocol for message logging, messages can be displayed in the CLI, saved in RAM, or sent to a server (show logging)
		*message format - seq: time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description
			seq: the order/sequence of messages
			time stamp: when messages was generated
			facility: a value that indicates which process on the device generated the message
			severity: how important this event seems to be
			MNEMONIC: a short code for the message, indicating what happened
			description: additional information about the event being reported
		*severity levels(each vendor interprets these levels differently there is not really a standard on what to do for each of these levels) 0-7
			"Because severities are very subjectuve, a relay or collector should not assume that all originatos have the same definition or severity. - RFC 5424(the syslog protocol)"
			0 emergency - system is unusable
			1 alert - action must be taken immediately
			2 critical - critical conditions
			3 error - error conditions
			4 warning - warning conditions
			5 notice(notification) - normal but significant condition
			6 informational - informational messages
			7 debugging - debug-level messages
			EACEWNID - EveryAwesomeCiscoEngineerWillNeedIcecramDaily
		
		Console line - enabled by default
		VTY line - disabled by default
		Buffer - enabled by default
		*External server - Syslog servers will listen for messages on UDP port 514
		CONFIGS: (logging synchronous) will prevent the logs from splitting your commands while inputting them into the system if a log occurs during this process
			logging console {6 | keyword} - enables logging for anything severity 6 and higher
			logging monitor {6 | informational} - enables logging for vty lines (tho you may have this command on the running config you will also have to type the (terminal monitor) command for every session to see the logs)
			logging buffered 8192 {infoamtional | 6} - enables logging to the buffer ... 8192 is the size of the buffer ... do not make buffer size to large so you dont use too much memory taking away resources
			logging 192.168.1.100 or logging host 192.168.1.100 - enables logging to an external server
			logging trap {debugging | 7} - sets logging level sent to the external server
			
			service timestamps log {datetime | uptime} - datetime is when event occured and uptime is how long device had been up when the event occured
			service sequence-numbers - enabled sequence numbers
	
	Network Time Protocol(NTP uses port UDP 123) - allows automatic syncing of time over a network, clients request the time from NTP servers, a device can be in client, server, and symmetric active mode at the same time
		all devices have an internal clock(show clock [detail], show calendar [detail])...by default the 'hardware calander' is considered the default time source...this time is not authoritative due to time drift
		MANUAL CLOCK CONFIGURATION, TIME ZONE CONFIGURATION, AND DAYLIGHT SAVING(SUMMER-TIME) TIME CONFIGURATION
			enable mode:
			(clock set 00:00:00 1 Dec 2025) command to set software clock
			(calendar set 00:00:00 1 Dec 2025) command to set hardware clock
			(clock update-calendar) command to sync the calendar to the clock's time, (clock read-calendar) command to sync the clock to the calendar's time

			global mode: (NTP only uses UTC timezone)
			(clock timezone timezone name hours-offsetfromUTC)
			(clock summer-time recurring name start end [offset])

		*Some NTP servers are 'better' than others. The 'distance' of an NTP server from the original reference clock is called stratum
		*A reference clock is usually a very accurate time device like an atomic clock or a GPS clock...these are stratum 0(US Navy clock)...the max is stratum 15 after that the source is unreliable
		*primary servers get their time from stratum 0 clocks and secondary servers get theirs from other NTP servers rather that be a server with a lower stratum or even equal stratum
		NTP CONFIGS:
			(ntp server 0.0.0.0 [prefer]) - it is best to have a device use more than one of these
			(show ntp associations) - show the ntp servers
			(show ntp status) - additional information about NTP
			(ntp master 0.0.0.0) - manually make the device act as an NTP master clock when there is not NTP server to sync too...it will use a loopback address(an address only reachable internally by that device) and will use a default stratum lvl of 8 for this command
			(ntp peer 0.0.0.0) - configure NTP symmetric active mode...which helps equal stratums sync and acts as backup

			R1(config)#interface loopback0
			R1(config-if)ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
			R1(config-if)exit
			R1(config)#ntp source loopback0

		NTP AUTHENTICATION(OPTIONAL) - allos NTP clients to ensure they only sync to the intended servers
			(ntp authenticate) enable NTP authentication
			(ntp authentication-key key-number md5 key) create the NTP authentication key(s)
			(ntp trusted-key key-number) specify the trusted key(s)
			(ntp server ip-address key key-number) specify which key to use for the server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Address Translation(NAT) - allows a host that does not have a valid, registered, globally unique IP address to communicate with other hosts throught the Internet. NAT will change the src IP for packets being sent from that host outside the network and change packets destination address when packets are being sent inside the network
	inside local - the private IP address of a device within the internal network
	inside global

	*outside local - this term is not used with source NAT. With destination NAT, the address would represent a host that resides outside the enterprise, but the address used to represent that host as packets pass through the local enterprise	
	outisde global - 

	STATIC NAT - one-to-one mapping is created between a private ip and a public ip...commonly used when an organization has internal servers(web, email, ftp) that need to be accessible from the internet...servers can have a private ip and still be reached over the internet
		Basic Static NAT
		Bidirectional Static NAT
		Port-Level Static NAT
		Static NAT with Overloading

	DYNAMIC NAT - 
		Basic Dynamic NAT
		Dynamic PAT
		Dynamic NAT with IP Pooling
		Dynamic NAT with Overlapping Address Ranges

	SOURCE NAT(only nat covered for CCNA) - enables private networks with non-routable private IP addresses to communicate with external networks using routable public IP addresses, facilitating connectivity and security between internal and external networks
	DESTINATION NAT - provides flexibility in routing incoming traffic to different destinations based on predefined rules, allowing for effiecient management and optimization of network resources

Wireless LANs using WI-FI - 802.11
	1.) all devices within range receive all frames, like devices connected to an Ethernet hub 
		privacy of data within the LAN is a greater concern
		CSMA/CA is used to faciliate half-duplex communications and is used in wireless networks to avoid collisions (not to be confused with CSMA/CD which is used in wired networkds)
		CSMA/CA will have a device wait for other devices to stop transmitting before it transmit data itself
	2.) wireless communication are regulated by various international and national bodies
	3.) wireless signal coverage area must be considered (singal range, absorption, reflextion, refraction, diffraction, and scattering)
		absorption - wireless signal passes through a material and is converted into heat, weakening the original signal
		reflection - signal bounces off of a material, for example metal
		refraction - wave is bent when entering a medium where the signal travels
		diffraction - wave encounters an obstacle and travels around it
		scattering - when a materail causes a singal to scatter in all directions (dust, smog, uneven surfaces, ect.)
	4.) other devices using the same channel can cause interference (ex. other wifi networks near by)
	
	RADIO FREQUENCY - to send wireless signals, the sender applies an alternating current to an antenna (this creates electromagnetic fields which propagate out as waves)
		amplitude - the maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium
		frequency - number of occurences of a repeating event per unit of time ... typically measured in Hz, where 1 Hz means one cycle per second
		period - the time it takes for one complete cycle to occur...it is the reciprocal of frequency ... if Hz is cycles per second then period is seconds per cycle (4 hz is 0.25 period ... (4/1)^-1 = 1/4)
		
		radio frequency range is from 30Hz to 300GHz and is used for many purposes...WIFI uses two main bands(freq. ranges)
		2.4GHz band : 2.400Ghz to 2.4835Ghz (typically provides further reach in open space and better penetration of obstacles such as walls ... but more devices use this range so that is an potential issue)
		5Ghz band: 5.150 Ghz to 5.825 Ghz (subdivided into four smaller bands)
		6Ghz band(802.11ax)
	
		*Each band is divided into multiple 'channels' ... devices are configured to transmit and receive traffic on one (or more) of these channels 
		*2.4Ghz band is divided into several channels, each with a 22MHz range (depending on what country you are in)
		*in larger WLANs with multiple APs it is important that adjacent APs do not use overlapping channels (1, 6, and 11 channels for 2.4 Ghz band)
	
	802.11 standards you should know (theoretical max data rate)
		802.11 - 2.4Ghz - 2Mbps
		802.11b - 2.4Ghz - 11Mbps
		802.11a - 5Ghz - 54Mbps
		802.11g - 2.4Ghz - 54Mbps
		802.11n - 2.4/5Ghz - 600Mbps (WI-FI 4)
		802.11ac - 5Ghz - 6.93Gbps (WI-FI 5)
		802.11ax - 2.4/5/6Ghz - 4*802.11ac (WI-FI 6)

	SERVICE SETS - groups of wireless network devices(three main types: Independent, Infrastructure, Mesh)
		all devices in service set share the SSID(human-readable and non-unique)
		Independent(ad hoc) - devices connect to eachother
		Infrastructure(BSS) - clients connect ot each other via an AP, but not directly to eachother
			AP can use the same SSID not BSSID(the MAC address of the AP)
			wireless devices(clients or stations) request to associate with the BSS
			the area around an AP where its signal is usable is call a Basic Service Area(BSA)
		Infrastructure(ESS) - creates a larger wireless LAN beyond the range of a single AP
			APs are connect via a wired network
			each BSS has its own BSSID and uses the same SSID
			each BSS uses different channe to avoid interference
			BSAs should overlap about 10-15% to enable a seemless roaming experice as the user goes from one channel to another
		Mesh(MBSS) - can be used in siuations where it is difficult to run an Ethernet connection to every AP
			mesh APs use two radios: one to provide a BSS to wireless clients, and one to form a 'backhaul netowrk' which is used to bridge traffic from AP to AP 
			at least one AP is connected to the wired network, and it is called the Root Access Point(RAP)
			other AP are clalled Mesh APs(MAP)
			a protocol is used to determine the best path through the mesh (similar to how dynamic routing protocols are used to determine the best path to a destination)

	DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM(DS) - most wireless networks are not standalone networks they somehow connect to a wired network infrastructure
		in 802.11, the upstream wired network is the DS ... each wireless BSS or ESS is mapped to a VLAN in the wired network
		it is possible for an AP(like a switch) to provide multiple wireless LANs, each with a unique SSID
		each WLAN is mapped to a separate VLAN and connected to the wired network via a trunk
		each WLAN uses a unique BSSID, usually by incrementing the last digit of the BSSID by one
		
	Additional AP Operational Modes:
		repeater - used to extend the range of a BSS by repeating the singnal (if the repeater only has one radio it must be in the same channel as the AP) since the singnal is being repeated in the same channel this will reduce overall throughput on the channel by like 50%
		workgroup bridge(uWGB) - operates as a wireless client of another AP, and can be used to connect wired devices to a wireless network (cisco has a version that can connect multiple wired deivces to a wired network at the same time)
		outdoor bridge - can be used to connect neworks over long distance without a physical cable connecting them
			specialized antennas that focus most of the signal power in one direction, which allos the wireless connection to be made over longer distances than normally possible
			the connection can be point-to-point as in the diagram below, or point-to-multipoint in which multiple sites connect to one central site
